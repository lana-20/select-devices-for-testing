# Selecting Devices and OS Versions for Testing

When selecting devices and OS versions for testing, I ask myself the following questions:
- What are the most used mobile OSs?
- What are the most used mobile OS versions?
- What are the most common screen sizes?
- Who are the leading manufacturers?

## What are the most used mobile OSs?
Mobile market [today](https://lana-20.github.io/mobile-os-market-share-2022/) looks much different from [10 years ago](https://lana-20.github.io/mobile-os-market-share-2012/). The market is dominated by two major vendors - Google (Android OS) and Apple (iOS).

## What are the most common screen sizes?

Google provides material.io [device metrics](https://material.io/blog/device-metrics), which includes iOS devices. It's a source of screen sizes, resolutions and other dimensions.
